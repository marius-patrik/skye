# SkyAgent Planning

Use this skill when the user has a concrete goal, asks what to do next, wants an upgrade route, or needs an auditable daily/weekly plan.

## Tool Routing

- Use `skyblock_plan_goal` for goal-specific plans, blockers, daily/weekly routes, prerequisites, and what to skip.
- Include `budget` when the user gives coins available.
- Use `skyblock_next_upgrades` for purchase ranking before recommending buys.
- Use planner bounds (`maxItems`, `networthTimeoutMs`, `maxPriceLookups`, `accessoryTimeoutMs`) for broad plans so networth/accessory fanout cannot block the session indefinitely.
- Use `skyagent_objective_create`, `skyagent_objective_list`, `skyagent_objective_update`, `skyagent_objective_complete`, and `skyagent_objective_delete` when a plan should become durable goals, tasks/todos, buy-list entries, source-list entries, or snipe targets.
- Start broad plans with `skyagent_context_bootstrap` so the plan has compact cached profile, gear, pets, accessories, readiness, provider freshness, warnings, and follow-up tools before pulling narrow details.
- Pull supporting detail with `skyblock_profile_snapshot`, `skyblock_profile_overview`, `skyblock_progression`, `skyblock_readiness`, `skyblock_networth`, `skyblock_accessories`, `skyblock_price`, or `skyblock_price_history` when the plan output needs profile, economy, progression, readiness, or price context. Prefer the snapshot cache for repeated planning passes and refresh it when current progress matters.
- Route patch-sensitive gear, money-making, class, boss, or route claims to `$skyagent-provider-maintenance` before making strong recommendations.

## Rules

- Preserve recommendation reason, expected impact, cost/time estimate, prerequisites, source freshness, uncertainty, and warnings.
- Planner outputs may consume partial networth or accessory valuation. Keep those partial/stale/unknown-price warnings visible and avoid presenting bounded totals as complete.
- Put immediate actions first, then medium-term route.
- Say what to skip when the planner output includes skip guidance.
- Do not recommend a buyable upgrade without budget and price evidence.
- When the user accepts a route, persist it as objective/task entries; persist purchase candidates as `buy` entries and auction watch rules as `snipe` entries with `itemId`, `targetPrice`, `budget`, `priority`, source provider, freshness, and warnings.
- Keep profile, economy, progression, readiness, and external meta assumptions visible in the final plan.
