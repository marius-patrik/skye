# SkyAgent Readiness/Weight

Use this skill when the user asks whether a profile is ready for an activity, asks for profile weight, or compares readiness against a goal.

## Tool Routing

- Use `skyblock_weight` for labeled profile-weight estimates, exact Senither/Lily unsupported status, formula provenance, assumptions, and missing data warnings.
- Use `skyblock_readiness` for activity readiness in `dungeons`, `slayer`, `kuudra`, `garden`, or `mining`.
- Use `skyblock_profile_section` or `skyblock_progression` first only when the user needs the underlying section evidence behind a readiness or weight result.
- Route pure section summaries back to `$skyagent-progression`.

## Rules

- Treat exact Senither/Lily-style weight as unsupported unless maintained formula tables are bundled and the tool reports exact support.
- Label current weight outputs as estimates when the tool reports unsupported exact formulas.
- Preserve formula freshness, source fields, assumptions, unsupported statuses, and missing-data warnings.
- Do not present heuristic readiness as a guarantee of success, party acceptance, or profit.
- Verify current external meta before strong recommendations about F7/M7, Slayer tiers, Kuudra tiers, Garden contests, Mining methods, or patch-sensitive gear thresholds.
- If required profile sections are missing, report readiness as unknown or partial instead of filling gaps with assumptions.
