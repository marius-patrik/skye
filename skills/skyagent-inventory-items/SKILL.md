# SkyAgent Inventory/Items

Use this skill when the task depends on item stacks, inventory API state, decoded NBT, normalized item records, or item metadata.

## Tool Routing

- Use `skyblock_inventory` for all supported sections or when the user asks for broad inventory, armor, equipment, wardrobe, backpacks, accessory bag, personal vault, ender chest, or pets context.
- Use `skyblock_inventory_section` for one named section such as `armor`, `equipment`, `wardrobe`, `inventory`, `ender_chest`, `backpacks`, `accessory_bag`, `personal_vault`, or `pets`.
- Use `skyblock_item_dump` only when the user asks for raw decoded NBT, parser debugging, item dumps, accessory bag item dumps, or exact low-level fields.
- Use `skyblock_normalized_items` before item reasoning across sections, upgrade checks, modifier comparisons, or user-facing item summaries.
- Use `skyblock_item_metadata` for NotEnoughUpdates-style item details, display names, rarity, category, NPC sale data, upgrade metadata, or fallback item identity.

## Rules

- Prefer normalized output for recommendations and summaries; request raw decoded debug data only when the user asks for parser details, missing fields, or exact NBT.
- Keep raw decoded NBT behind explicit debug requests.
- Report disabled inventory API, missing sections, or partial profile data as warnings instead of treating them as empty inventories.
- For corrupt NBT, preserve the affected section/container ID when available, warn clearly, and continue with unaffected sections.
- If item metadata is unavailable, continue with normalized item IDs and mark metadata-backed fields as unavailable.
- Do not infer item modifiers that are not present in normalized records.
