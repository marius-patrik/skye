# SkyAgent Repo Rules

## Scope

This repository builds a Codex plugin, CLI, and MCP server for Hypixel SkyBlock profile analysis.

Future web app work should use Bun, Rsbuild, React, TypeScript, and shadcn/ui. Defer additional framework, state, styling, deployment, and database choices until the web app requirements are clear.

Do not implement web app work unless the user explicitly requests it for the current issue. Existing web stack notes are constraints for approved web work, not permission to start it.

Do not implement Minecraft mod or mcmod work unless the user explicitly requests it and a dedicated implementation issue spec exists. Documentation-only issues may define future contracts, but must not add `packages/mcmod`, Fabric build files, Minecraft runtime dependencies, or mod source code. Mod implementation is deferred until explicit user instruction.

## Operating Mode

- Work issue-first. Do not implement a slice until a GitHub issue exists with the exact spec, non-goals, acceptance criteria, and validation commands.
- Treat the issue spec as the contract. If implementation reveals missing scope, update or split the issue before coding beyond it.
- Execute implementation issues sequentially. Finish, merge, or explicitly park the current issue before starting another implementation slice.
- Use the full delivery loop for each slice: issue spec, dev branch, implementation, validation, PR, CI/Codex Review, merge to `main`, then next issue.
- Use subagents for bounded sidecar research, implementation, review, test investigation, or parallel inspection when they materially improve throughput. Keep final implementation ownership, integration, and merge decisions coordinated by the primary agent.
- Prefer spec-driven development: write or update the expected behavior and validation target before broad implementation, then keep code changes scoped to that spec.

## Source Priority

- Prefer official Hypixel API data and official Hypixel docs for endpoint behavior.
- Prefer live profile data over assumptions.
- Treat SkyCrypt, SkyHelper, NotEnoughUpdates, CoflNet, Bazaar trackers, and Discord bot behavior as parity references, not authoritative game truth.
- Verify meta-sensitive claims with current sources before making strong recommendations.

## Secrets and User Data

- Do not commit API keys, profile snapshots, cache files, or personal config.
- Read `HYPIXEL_API_KEY` before any stored config key.
- Store local config and memories outside the repo through `scripts/lib/store.ts`.
- Do not print API key values in CLI or MCP responses.
- Keep `.env.example` placeholder-only.

## Architecture

- Prefer TypeScript over JavaScript whenever possible.
- Keep packages as first-class workspaces. Shared domain, API, config, parsing, and calculator code belongs in `@skyagent/core` before being wired into CLI, MCP, TUI, or web surfaces.
- Keep shared transport/API code in `packages/core/src/hypixel.ts`.
- Keep user config and memory persistence in `packages/core/src/store.ts`.
- Keep profile-level extraction and SkyCrypt-style viewer helpers in `packages/core/src/profile.ts`.
- Add new parser/calculator modules under `packages/core/src/` before expanding CLI/MCP/TUI/web wiring.
- Keep CLI command wiring in `packages/cli/src/`; `scripts/skyagent.ts` is only a compatibility wrapper.
- Keep MCP tool schemas and dispatch in `packages/mcp/src/`; `scripts/mcp-server.ts` is only a compatibility wrapper.
- Keep interactive terminal UI work in `packages/tui/` and depend on `@skyagent/core`; do not import CLI or MCP internals.
- Keep web app work in `packages/web/` using Bun, Rsbuild, React, TypeScript, and shadcn/ui conventions; depend on `@skyagent/core` rather than importing CLI, MCP, or TUI internals.
- Treat web app and Minecraft mod implementation as deferred work unless the current issue explicitly authorizes that surface. A telemetry contract issue authorizes docs and validation only, not Fabric implementation.

## Skillset Maintenance

- Keep `skills/hypixel-skyblock` as the broad orchestration skill for general user requests and cross-domain routing.
- Add focused SkyAgent subskills under `skills/skyagent-*` for stable domains: profile/API lookup, inventory/items, economy/pricing/networth, accessories/upgrades, progression/readiness, goal planning, and provider maintenance/meta verification.
- Each skill folder must contain a concise `SKILL.md` with clear trigger language in frontmatter and an `agents/openai.yaml` with display metadata.
- Keep subskill bodies short; move detailed domain tables or long procedures into `references/` only when a future issue needs them.
- When MCP tools are added, update the broad orchestration skill and any focused subskill that should prefer those tools.
- Run skill validation for every folder under `skills/` before opening a PR that changes skill content or routing.

## API and Tool Design

- Every high-value CLI operation should have a matching MCP tool.
- Keep `hypixel_request` as an escape hatch, but add named abstractions for common SkyBlock workflows.
- Return JSON from CLI commands.
- MCP tool responses should be JSON text content.
- Prefer compact summaries for planning workflows and raw payload access for debugging.
- Inventory commands and MCP tools should keep raw decoded NBT behind an explicit debug option.
- Item normalization should stay deterministic and should include metadata provider provenance and fallback warnings.
- Price providers must return confidence, provider method, cache status, stale status, fallback chain, and warnings instead of inventing values.

## Parity Roadmap

- Track SkyCrypt/SkyHelper parity gaps in `docs/parity.md`.
- Inventory/NBT parsing, item normalization, pricing, networth, missing accessories, and profile section extractors are separate layers.
- Do not present derived calculations as complete until their data provider and assumptions are documented.

## Validation

Run before committing:

```powershell
npm run check
python C:\Users\patrik\.codex\skills\.system\plugin-creator\scripts\validate_plugin.py C:\Users\patrik\projects\skyagent
python C:\Users\patrik\.codex\skills\.system\skill-creator\scripts\quick_validate.py C:\Users\patrik\projects\skyagent\skills\hypixel-skyblock
```

After plugin manifest or tool-surface changes, update the plugin cachebuster and reinstall:

```powershell
python C:\Users\patrik\.codex\skills\.system\plugin-creator\scripts\update_plugin_cachebuster.py C:\Users\patrik\projects\skyagent
codex plugin add skyagent@personal
```

## Git

- Keep `main` deployable.
- Do not implement directly on `main`.
- Create a corresponding GitHub issue before starting each slice of work.
- The issue must include the exact spec and acceptance criteria for that slice.
- Do each slice on a feature/dev branch named for the issue, such as `dev/issue-12-short-topic`.
- Land each slice to `main` through a PR from the dev branch.
- The PR must close the corresponding issue on merge.
- Main should receive one commit per slice. Use a single focused commit on the branch or squash-merge the PR.
- Do not batch unrelated issues into one branch or PR.
- Do not start the next issue's implementation until the previous issue has merged, unless the user explicitly asks to run issues in parallel.
- Add the `automerge` label only when a PR is intended to merge automatically after CI and Codex autoreview pass.
- Codex autoreview uses the GitHub secret `CODEX_AUTH_JSON`, containing Codex OAuth `auth.json`; do not use `OPENAI_API_KEY` for this repo's Codex CI review.
- Keep the Codex autoreview runtime bundled in `.github/codex-review.Dockerfile` instead of installing Codex ad hoc in the workflow.
- Commit focused changes with concise messages.
- Push completed repo-rule, plugin, CLI, MCP, and skill changes to the dev branch, then open a PR.
