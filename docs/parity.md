# SkyBlock Tool Parity

SkyAgent covers official Hypixel API transport, profile context, inventory parsing, item normalization, economy estimates, progression sections, planning primitives, and local agent surfaces. It is still not at full SkyCrypt or Discord bot feature parity.

For the detailed implementation spec and future issue slices, see `docs/parity-spec.md`.
For the current 2.0 public-readiness gap map and owning issues, see `docs/public-readiness-gaps.md`.

## Covered

- Mojang username to UUID resolution.
- Hypixel v2 raw request escape hatch.
- Player, status, SkyBlock profiles, profile by ID, museum, garden, player bingo.
- Public SkyBlock resources: collections, skills, items, election, bingo.
- Public economy/event surfaces: Bazaar, auctions, ended auctions, fire sales.
- Compact profile summaries, selected member extraction, overview metadata, and SkyCrypt URL generation.
- Local config and memory storage outside the repo.
- Inventory decoding for base64 gzipped NBT fields, including current and legacy inventory sections, wardrobe/loadout armor, backpacks, accessory bag, personal vault, and pets when exposed by the profile payload.
- Deterministic item normalization for common SkyBlock item records, including IDs, rarity/category/count, reforges, enchantments, attributes, gemstones, dungeon modifiers, recombobulation, pet info, and metadata provider provenance where available.
- Conservative sectioned networth for purse, bank, and resolved direct item prices, with unknown prices and assumptions surfaced.
- Accessory bag analysis with duplicate detection, recombobulation/enrichment signals, estimated Magical Power, missing accessories when metadata is available, and price-driven coin-per-MP upgrade ranking.
- Shared progression section framework with skill, Catacombs, Slayer XP curves plus sections for skills, Dungeons, Slayer, Mining/HotM, Garden, Bestiary, Collections, Minions, Museum, Crimson Isle/Kuudra, Rift, Trophy Fishing, Pets, Essence, currencies, and unlocks. Outputs include source fields, missing-data warnings, formulas/tables, and provenance.
- Weight and readiness estimators for broad profile comparison and dungeons, Slayer, Kuudra, Garden, and Mining readiness. Exact Senither/Lily formulas are explicitly marked unsupported until maintained formula tables are bundled.
- Deterministic goal planner and next-upgrade output that compose networth, accessory upgrades, readiness, memories/config context, source freshness, assumptions, and warnings.
- Recommendation-grade pet and wardrobe/loadout normalization for agent context: pets expose stable type, tier, XP, active state, held item, skin, candy count, source path, and explicit missing level-formula warnings; wardrobe output distinguishes true wardrobe contents from loadout armor fallback with loadout slot, armor slot, current/unknown state, partial-loadout warnings, and source metadata.

## Missing for SkyCrypt-Style Parity

- SkyCrypt/SkyHelper-grade networth calculation, including modifier, pet-level, skin, dye, museum, and miscellaneous valuables.
- SkyHelper-grade missing accessories when a full maintained accessory universe is unavailable.
- Compact startup context that includes all hidden storage, sacks, Museum signals, profile availability flags, and coop/member provenance.
- Museum donation planning that ranks already-owned, hidden-owned, missing, buy, source, and snipe candidates.
- Full profile-viewer depth inside each progression section, including detailed SkyCrypt-grade UI breakdowns, per-floor dungeon badges, exact Garden milestone tables, full Museum item valuation, and richer Crimson Isle/Rift objective readiness.
- Exact Senither/Lily weight parity and maintained reference-formula synchronization.
- Gear-aware target readiness for specific Slayer bosses/tiers, Dungeon floors, Kuudra tiers, and damage goals.
- Deep goal-specific route optimization with exact gear, pet, class, party-finder, money route, farming crop, and time-to-complete models.
- Historical price sources and full lowest-BIN search beyond bounded auction-page scans.

## Current Networth Limits

- Direct item IDs are valued through the price provider layer; unresolved prices are listed under `unknownPrices` and excluded from totals.
- Purse and bank are included.
- Inventory sections are separated for armor, equipment, wardrobe, inventory, ender chest, backpacks, accessory bag, personal vault, and pets when exposed by the Hypixel profile payload.
- Item modifiers, pet levels, skins, dyes, attributes, enchantments, gemstones, recombobulation, and museum state are preserved as assumptions/context but are not independently valued yet.
- Pet XP is preserved, but exact pet level is not derived until a maintained pet XP formula/provider is bundled. Pet networth, pet score, and skin valuation are not claimed as SkyCrypt/SkyHelper parity.
- Results include provider freshness and confidence metadata and should be treated as estimates, not authoritative SkyCrypt/SkyHelper replacements.

## Current Accessory Limits

- Magical Power is estimated from accessory rarity and recombobulation state unless provider metadata supplies an exact MP value.
- Missing accessories require accessory universe metadata. When no full provider is configured, SkyAgent reports owned accessory state and a structured warning instead of inventing missing items.
- Upgrade rankings include only resolved prices; unknown and partial candidate prices are surfaced but excluded from budget rankings.
- Accessory family/upgrade-chain handling depends on explicit provider metadata. Hypixel item resources do not expose upgrade-chain families, so those IDs are treated as their own families until a richer maintained provider is configured.
- Budget rankings recommend only the next missing MP step per accessory family until provider metadata can model cumulative chain dependencies.

## Common Tool Signals

- SkyCrypt presents profile viewer sections such as stats, skills, armor, weapons, accessories, and uses Hypixel API, NotEnoughUpdates data, and SkyHelper Networth.
- SkyHelper-style bots commonly expose networth, item networth, profile lookup by user/profile, and utility endpoints such as Fetchur.
- Discord bot lists commonly advertise networth, missing accessories/talismans, stat optimization, bazaar prices, lowest BIN, auctions, minions, timers, updates, profile stats, skills, Dungeons, and Slayer.

## Next Implementation Layers

1. Expand compact startup context with hidden storage, Museum, sacks, coop, and availability signals.
2. Add Museum donation planning with hidden-owned candidate routing and bounded pricing.
3. Upgrade readiness into target-aware gear, pet, accessory, modifier, and budget checks.
4. Add route-specific planner modules for money, farming, Dungeon, Kuudra, buy, source, and snipe planning.
5. Deepen provider metadata for pet levels, skins, dyes, Museum eligibility/value, accessory families, item modifiers, and price confidence.
6. Add cross-surface parity tests so CLI, MCP, gateway, TUI, docs, and skills stay aligned.
